Big Data in the Browser
=======================

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook/presentation that was first presented
at GOTO Amsterdam 2015.

The notebook containing the presentation is:
   [Big Data in the Browser.ipynb](Big Data in the Browser.ipynb)

As checked in, the notebook contains most cells pre-rendered so you can view it
without having to execute all the examples.

To view as a presentation you need to have the [RISE Jupyter Plugin][rise] installed.
Before starting a presentation I:

1. Clear the output of all cells.
2. Delete the 'Although it may not be clear yet' text from the 5<sup>th</sup> cell.
